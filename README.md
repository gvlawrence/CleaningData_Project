## Instructions
To use this code:

1. ensure file *run_analysis.R* and data directory *UCI HAR Dataset* exist in the same directory.
2. where necessary, the data directory can be created by unzipping *UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip* (the URL of this zip file
is listed in the CodeBook).
3. set the working directory for R (or RStudio) to the one identified in step 1 (containing the code and data).
4. run file *run_analysis.R*.
5. this will create the main output file (which includes averages) called *HAR_TidyData.txt*.

File *CodeBook.md* contains further detail about the data used and the code steps used to produce the tidy data set.

## Source data and output files
A copy of the source zip file (found at the URL mentioned in the CodeBook) is provided for reference, in case
the data is no longer available at that URL. 

The output file is provided as an example of the result of running the code with the specified data.
