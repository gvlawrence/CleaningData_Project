## Instructions
To use this code:

1. ensure file *run_analysis.R* and data directory *UCI HAR Dataset* exist in the same directory.
2. where necessary, the data directory can be created by unzipping *UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip* (the URL of this zip file
is listed in the CodeBook).
3. set the working directory for R (or RStudio) to the one identified in step 1 (containing the code and data).
4. run file *run_analysis.R*.
5. this will create the main output file (which includes averages) called *HAR_TidyData.txt*.

File *CodeBook.md* contains further detail about the data used and the code steps used to produce the tidy data set.

## Source data and output files
A copy of the source data found at the URL specified in the CodeBook is provided for reference should the data no longer be available at that URL.  To use this data, a copy should be placed locally and named *UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip* and the code amended to skip the file download.

The output file is provided for reference and shows the result of running the code on the specified data set.
